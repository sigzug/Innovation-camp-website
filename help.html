      <h2>MyAttendance was a project created during </h2>
      <p>
        This project was developed to help Ethiopia with the problem of attendance in school. 
        Its purpose is to collect data of when the students are attending school, to map and 
        pinpoints areas where students are unable to meet up to their school. The teacher logs 
        in with an pre-made account and selects which school and class they work in. The teacher 
        then "checks-off" which of the students who have been in class. This is then stored in 
        servers on national level and used to create detailed statistics on how and when the 
        students skip school.
