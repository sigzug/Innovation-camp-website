      <h2>MyAttendance was a project created during </h2>
      <p>
        This project is about helping Ethiopia with the problem og attendence in school.
        Its purpose is to collect data of when the students are attending school.
        The teacher logs in with an pre-made account and selcts which schol and
        class he/she is refering to. Then the teacher "cheks-of" which of the
        students who have been in class. This is then stored in servers on national
        level and used to create detailed statistics on how and when the students
        skip school.
